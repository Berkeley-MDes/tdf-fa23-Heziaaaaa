# Report 1 - Week of 08/31/2023 #

In this week report, I have worked on three things

1. Test out the Rhino and Grasshopper file;
2. Set up laser cut file in Adobe Illustrator;
3. Test out laser cut.

### ðŸ’¡ Rhino & Grasshopper file ###
I firstly played around with the Rhino file and Grasshopper file to explore the possibility of the given design.

1. This is the original setting of the Grasshopper file for the plywood cellphone stand.

2.   Then, I set the iphone dimension to Iphone 14 Pro Max, whose dimension is 77.6 mm Ã— 160.7 mm Ã— 7.9 mm. When I was played around with the GH file, I found that there was limitation to the angle that ths user could adjust to. The maximum angle is `96` and the minimum angle is `42`.
   
   - When the angle is `97`, the Grasshopper file reported error with red preview in Rhino. No preview is shown in the "DrawingsView".

   - The below image shows the Rhino preview when the `maximum` angle of `96` is reached.

   - When the angle is `41`, the Grasshopper file reported error with red preview in Rhino. No preview is shown in the "DrawingsView".

   - The below image shows the Rhino preview when the `minimum` angle of `42` is reached.

3.  After exploring the constraint of the GH file, I stayed at the "PhoneCameraView" window to find out the most desired shooting angle for me, set the angle to `76`.

   - "PhoneCameraView" & "HumanView" for selected angle `76`

   - "DrawingView" for selected angle `76`
