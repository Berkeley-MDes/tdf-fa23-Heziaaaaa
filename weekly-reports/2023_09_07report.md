# Report 2 - Week of 09/07/2023 #

### In this week's report, I am mainly ideating possible designs for my own cell phone stand.
<br>

I am currently considering two possibilities for the cell phone stand to be able to adjust to different phone size and shooting angles
<br>

1. The cell phone stand itself is adjustable with ***multiple grooves or notches*** that can be slotted in (like multiple modes or system presets). 
2. The design itself is ***parametric*** so that it can be adjusted in ***Grasshopper***  according to the input data (like TJâ€™s Grasshopper file).

# :one: Adjustable Design of Cell Phone Stand #


The followings are some of my initial ideas and diagrams of how the cell phone stand itself is adjustable, each with their pros and cons.


### 1.  Wavy Cell Phone Stand ###


   **Pros:**
   
    - The form is aesthetic
    - Offers additional functionalities, such as a pen holder

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles is available
    - Unable to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - The use of material is not very efficient

### 2.  Mortise and tenon joint structure ###


   **Pros:**
   
    - The form is aesthetic
    - Offers additional functionalities, such as a pen holder

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles is available
    - Unable to charge the phone when it is on the stand
