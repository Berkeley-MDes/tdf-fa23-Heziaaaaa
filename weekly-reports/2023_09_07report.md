# Report 2 - Week of 09/07/2023 #

### In this week's report, I am mainly ideating possible designs for my own cell phone stand.
<br>

I am currently considering two possibilities for the cell phone stand to be able to adjust to different phone size and shooting angles
<br>

1. The cell phone stand itself is adjustable with ***multiple grooves or notches*** that can be slotted in (like multiple modes or system presets). 
2. The design itself is ***parametric*** so that it can be adjusted in ***Grasshopper***  according to the input data (like TJ’s Grasshopper file).

# :one: Adjustable Design of Cell Phone Stand #


The followings are some of my initial ideas and diagrams of how the cell phone stand itself is adjustable, each with their pros and cons.

<br>

### 1.  Wavy Cell Phone Stand ###

</p>

   **Pros:**
   
    - The form is aesthetic
    - Offers additional functionalities, such as a pen holder

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles are available
    - Unable to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - The form is fixed and rigid, which takes up plenty of packing space and it is inconvenient to carry around

### 2.  Pegboard Stand ###

 <img width="800" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Pegboard.png">
</p>

Inspired by the design of pegboard, the concept of a cell phone stand emerges with a flexible grid of holes and attachments. This adaptable structure allows users to customize their phone stands, effortlessly adjusting angles and configurations to meet their specific needs, emphasizing convenience and versatility.

   **Pros:**
   
    - Able to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - It is collapsable, which make it convenient to bring around

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles are available
    - The form is not that aesthetic

# :two: Potential Parametric Design of Cell Phone Stand #

This section is about the potential parametric design of the cell phone stand. The concept is much like what TJ shows in the Grasshopper file: the form itself is rigid and unadjustable, but the designs can be customized via parametric method with input datas (like the desired shooting height, angle, and phone model, etc). 

<br>

### 1.  "X" Lock ###

<p align="center">
 <img width="900" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/_X_ Lock.png">
</p>

The design is inspired by the Chinese traditional mortise and tenon joint, where each piece is flat with speicial design of grooves or notches, so that they can be locked into each other and forms rigid 3D structure. The design intergrates a similar interlocking mechanism could empower users to tailor their stands efficiently, ensuring both stability and versatility.

<br>

There are two possibilites for this model:
   
   (a) each piece has multiple notches at different positions. When they are locked into each other, they results in various angles and heights.
   
   **Pros:**
   
    - It is more convenient for the user, since one set of stand can provides multiple angels and heights.

   **Cons:**
   
    - Due to the thickness of the material and laser cutter's limitation of only capable of cutting straight angles,
      the two pieces can only be locked into each other perpendicularly, which either greatly limits the number of 
      available shooting angles, or makes the sturcture to wiggle in certian notches.

<br>
    
   (b) each piece only has one notch. If the angle and height needs to be adjusted, the position of notch needs to be regenerated in Grasshopper.
   
   **Pros:**
   
    - Accomodate the limitation of laser cutter.
    - With less variation, the structure is always strong and stable.

   **Cons:**
   
    - May be inconvenient for the users, since each set of cell phone stand can only provide one angle and height.

## 2.  Mortise and Tenon Joint Cell Phone Stand (⭐ selected to develope further) ##

<p align="center">
 <img width="800" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Mortise and tenon joint.png">
</p>

This design is much inspired by TJ's Grasshopper file of the laser cutting version cell phone stand, and it is also a combination with the above mentioned mortise and tenon joint. The main idea of this design is to resolve the problem of material waste in the original design and to incorporate the new form into the existing wire connection logic in TJ's Grasshopper file.

<br>

<p align="center">
 <img width="650"  src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-1/wood_stand_14promax_angle_76.png"><img width="650" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Layour waste.png">
</p>

As can be seen, despite the cutout area hatched in black, there are plenty of waste material resulted from the inefficient form. A plywood piece with the dimension of 1/4" x 18" x 30" can only produce a maximum of 7 sets of cell phone stands. What is even worse is that the leftover scratches are all of irregular shapes, which make them difficult to be reused in other projects.


<p align="center">
 <img width="700" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Simplest.png">
</p>

Let's get back to the simplest composition of a cell phone stand. It actually only needs two triangular vertical stands with a little platform anchor at the end to support the phone. However, according to the original design, material waste happens in the middle of the two vertical standing pieces.

</p>

<h1 align="center"> :arrow_down:  </h1>

By integrating the tip corner into the opposite vertical piece, the waste area in the middle is saved

 <img width="700" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Modify-2.png">
</p>

Then I realized the structure lacks lateral support, so I carved out two lateral bracing in the middle of each vertical stand. 

<h1 align="center"> :arrow_down:  </h1>

</p>

In this way, the cutout piece is of regular shape and the material is efficiently used. The vision is that the middle division line of the design will change according to the user's requirement of different viewing angles. After the angle of the middle division line is set, a new minimum bounding box will be generated, and the lateral support piece will be added on correspondingly.


###  :fast_forward: Progressing process of the design ###
