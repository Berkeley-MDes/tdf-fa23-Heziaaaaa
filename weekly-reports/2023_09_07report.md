# Report 2 - Week of 09/07/2023 #

### In this week's report, I am mainly ideating possible designs for my own cell phone stand.
<br>

I am currently considering two possibilities for the cell phone stand to be able to adjust to different phone size and shooting angles
<br>

1. The cell phone stand itself is adjustable with ***multiple grooves or notches*** that can be slotted in (like multiple modes or system presets). 
2. The design itself is ***parametric*** so that it can be adjusted in ***Grasshopper***  according to the input data (like TJâ€™s Grasshopper file).

# :one: Adjustable Design of Cell Phone Stand #


The followings are some of my initial ideas and diagrams of how the cell phone stand itself is adjustable, each with their pros and cons.

<br>

### 1.  Wavy Cell Phone Stand ###

</p>

   **Pros:**
   
    - The form is aesthetic
    - Offers additional functionalities, such as a pen holder

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles are available
    - Unable to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - The form is fixed and rigid, which takes up plenty of packing space and it is inconvenient to carry around

### 2.  Pegboard Stand ###

</p>

Inspired by the design of pegboard, the concept of a cell phone stand emerges with a flexible grid of holes and attachments. This adaptable structure allows users to customize their phone stands, effortlessly adjusting angles and configurations to meet their specific needs, emphasizing convenience and versatility.

   **Pros:**
   
    - Able to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - It is collapsable, which make it convenient to bring around

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles are available
    - The form is not that aesthetic

# :two: Potential Parametric Design of Cell Phone Stand #

This section is about the potential parametric design of the cell phone stand. The concept is much like what TJ shows in the Grasshopper file: the form itself is rigid and unadjustable, but the designs can be customized via parametric method with input datas (like the desired shooting height, angle, and phone model, etc).

### 1.  "X" Lock ###

    - The form is aesthetic
    - Offers additional functionalities, such as a pen holder

    - Unable to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - The form is fixed and rigid, which takes up plenty of packing space and it is inconvenient to carry around
