# Report 2 - Week of 09/07/2023 #

### In this week's report, I am mainly ideating possible designs for my own cell phone stand.
<br>

I am currently considering two possibilities for the cell phone stand to be able to adjust to different phone size and shooting angles
<br>

1. The cell phone stand itself is adjustable with ***multiple grooves or notches*** that can be slotted in (like multiple modes or system presets). 
2. The design itself is ***parametric*** so that it can be adjusted in ***Grasshopper***  according to the input data (like TJâ€™s Grasshopper file).

# :one: Adjustable Design of Cell Phone Stand #


The followings are some of my initial ideas and diagrams of how the cell phone stand itself is adjustable, each with their pros and cons.

<br>

### 1.  Wavy Cell Phone Stand ###

</p>

   **Pros:**
   
    - The form is aesthetic
    - Offers additional functionalities, such as a pen holder

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles are available
    - Unable to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - The form is fixed and rigid, which takes up plenty of packing space and it is inconvenient to carry around

### 2.  Pegboard Stand ###

</p>

Inspired by the design of pegboard, the concept of a cell phone stand emerges with a flexible grid of holes and attachments. This adaptable structure allows users to customize their phone stands, effortlessly adjusting angles and configurations to meet their specific needs, emphasizing convenience and versatility.

   **Pros:**
   
    - Able to charge the phone when it is on the stand
    - It is collapsable, which make it convenient to bring around

   **Cons:**
   
    - Only few angles are available
    - The form is not that aesthetic

# :two: Potential Parametric Design of Cell Phone Stand #

This section is about the potential parametric design of the cell phone stand. The concept is much like what TJ shows in the Grasshopper file: the form itself is rigid and unadjustable, but the designs can be customized via parametric method with input datas (like the desired shooting height, angle, and phone model, etc). 

<br>

### 1.  "X" Lock ###

<p align="center">
 <img width="900" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/_X_ Lock.png">
</p>

The design is inspired by the Chinese traditional mortise and tenon joint, where each piece is flat with speicial design of grooves or notches, so that they can be locked into each other and forms rigid 3D structure. The design intergrates a similar interlocking mechanism could empower users to tailor their stands efficiently, ensuring both stability and versatility.

<br>

There are two possibilites for this model:
   
   (a) each piece has multiple notches at different positions. When they are locked into each other, they results in various angles and heights.
   
   **Pros:**
   
    - It is more convenient for the user, since one set of stand can provides multiple angels and heights.

   **Cons:**
   
    - Due to the thickness of the material and laser cutter's limitation of only capable of cutting straight angles,
      the two pieces can only be locked into each other perpendicularly, which either greatly limits the number of 
      available shooting angles, or makes the sturcture to wiggle in certian notches.

<br>
    
   (b) each piece only have one notch. If the angle and height needs to be adjusted, the position of notch needs to be regenerated in Grasshopper.
   
   **Pros:**
   
    - Accomodate the limitation of laser cutter.
    - With less variation, the structure is always strong and stable.

   **Cons:**
   
    - May be inconvenient for the users, since each set of cell phone stand can only provide one angle and height.

### 2.  Pegboard Stand ###
