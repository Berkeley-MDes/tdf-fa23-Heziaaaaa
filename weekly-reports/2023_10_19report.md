# Report 7 - Week of 10/19/2023 #

### During this week, I worked on the final construction of the meditation flower and assisted the documentation of the project and video-editing of the final video presentation.

### üî®. Model Making
Thanks to the lesson learn from the first fetal test, the fabrication process for the final design went smoother. I changed the laser cutting file a little bit to include the holes for zip tie and fishing line on each petal. And I also spray painted the petals with satin white to give a cleaner look.

After we assembled the skeleton and anchored the servo successfully, the next challenge is to attached the petals properly to the central rotation disc. In order to make the mechanism to work,  the distance between each set of petals (one petal on each 5 ring, so 5 petals count as a set) should be the same and non-movable. Therefore, we use fishing line to connect all the petals set by set, layer by layer, with hot glue gun and super glue to make a ‚Äúknot‚Äù to properly anchor the fishing line on the petals.

### ü§™. Success‚Ä¶but with a light setback

I was super aware of the fact that even though the rotation mechanism worked by itself, it might not work when it is actually connected to the servo. Therefore, Adorey and I was constantly testing with the servo when we were assembly the flower. The servo worked perfectly when we attached it with one set of flower petals.

</br>

   </p>

</br>

The mechanism continued to work when two sets of flower petals were attached.

   </p>

</br>

However, to my surprise, the servo didn‚Äôt provide enough torque for all sets of flower petals to work. We even tried external power supply with 6 voltages, but the torque the servo was able to provide didn‚Äôt seem to change a lot.

   </p>

</br>

Finally, we decided to cut off the strings that connected to the bottom three layers of petals. The servo successfully pulled up the top two layers of petals. The below images show the demonstration for the final design.

Besides, I was also in charge of collecting and organizing all the videos and pictures for the project except for the coding part.  also took on the responsibility of editing the introductory and mechanism sections of the presentation video‚Äôs first half.

## Speculation

Currently, we are only able to achieve the effect of syncing between the flower and the wristband with a set breathing pattern in the code as shown below. 

</br>

   </p>

</br>

Therefore, it is not actually reacting to any input source, like a clip of meditation music or meditation breathing guide, coordinately, which make the device not that intuitive to use.

To further develop this project, the user flow should be as follow:
1. The user initiates a meditation session via a mobile application, selecting or customizing their breathing pattern and pace.
2. The selected pattern will be transform into a set of data of {breath, hold, breath, hold‚Ä¶}, which is sent synchronically to the flower and the wristband.
3. The Meditation Blossom responds by opening and closing in tandem with the selected breathing pattern, while simultaneously illuminating to establish a serene environment.
4. The wristband vibrates in sync with the pattern, providing tactile cues to assist the user in maintaining the prescribed breathing rhythm.

Also, due to the time limit and the limitation of the maximum voltage, we didn‚Äôt add the lighting effect to the flower. It will be interesting to work out how to have one more lighting device synced with the vibrator and the servo.

## Reflection

I feel that my team and I collaborated seamlessly within our limited timeframe, successfully turning our ideas into reality. However, if there's room for improvement, I would point to communication and time management. Since our team had more members compared to others, it was sometimes challenging to coordinate and ensure that all team members were up-to-date with the information. There was a lack of clear coordination regarding team members' expectations for the project and the level of effort they wanted to contribute, which occasionally resulted in uneven distribution of tasks.

Personally, I believe I tended to stick to what I was already familiar with, not fully challenging myself in areas I was less acquainted with, such as mechanical and coding. I think I need to push myself more to acquire new coding and technical knowledge. Fortunately, within our team collaboration, I inevitably became more exposed to diverse knowledge and learned how to collaborate with people from different backgrounds and fields.
