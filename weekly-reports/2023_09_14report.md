# Report 3 - Week of 09/14/2023 #

### For this week, I worked on:
#### 1. Realize my design in Grasshopper and Rhino. 
#### 2. Laser cut testing of two sets of the design.
#### 3. Make a video documentation of the entire process.
<br>

### :exclamation: Before we start this week's report, Watch this Youtube video fist!!! It encapsulates the entire design journey of the cell phone stand.
<br>

# :one: Objective of the Design

My design is mainly build upon the 2D laser cutting version cell phone stand provided by TJ. After testing out the original file, I realized that the material usage is not very efficient. 

<p align="center">

 <img width="650" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Layour waste.png">
</p>

As can be seen, despite the cutout area hatched in black, there is plenty of waste material resulting from the inefficient form. A plywood piece with the dimension of 1/4" x 18" x 30" can only produce a maximum of 7 sets of cell phone stands. What is even worse is that the leftover scratches are all of irregular shapes, which make them difficult to be reused in other projects.

 </p>
 
Therefore, it makes me wonder is it possible to design a more material-efficient way based on TJ‚Äôs file?
And here is the thinking process.

<br>

Let's get back to the simplest composition of a cell phone stand. 


<p align="center">
 <img width="700" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Simplest.png">
</p>

It actually only needs two triangular vertical stands with a little platform anchor at the end to support the phone. However, according to the original design, material waste happens in the middle of the two vertical standing pieces. 

<p align="center">
 <img width="700" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Modify-1.png">
</p>

By integrating the tip corner into the opposite vertical piece, the waste area in the middle is saved


<p align="center">
 <img width="700" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-2/Modify-2.png">
</p>

Then I realized the structure lacks lateral support, so I carved out two lateral bracing in the middle of each vertical stand.

</p>

In this way, the cutout piece is of regular shape and the material is efficiently used. The vision is that the middle division line of the design will change according to the user's requirement of different viewing angles. After the angle of the middle division line is set, a new minimum bounding box will be generated, and the lateral support piece will be added on correspondingly.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£: Wireframe walkthrough in Grasshopper

#### :one: : The first step is to draw out the middle division line and its two tip corners at the two ends of it. The length of the division line is linked to the length of the phone `(phone length / 1.7)`. The two tip corners are always `90 degrees` to the middle division line and they can also be adjusted according to the thickness of the phone.

</p>

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ : The second step is to rotate the zig-zag line component to the desired angle. The angle is adjusted as `Viewing Angle'. And then make the 2D outline into 3D volume and rotate and move the two vertical stands into the right position in relation to the 3D tilted phone model.

</p>

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ : The third step is to define the minimum bounding box around the zig-zag line.

</p>

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ : The fourth step is to create the lateral support cutout shape in 2D and then add the lateral support cutout to the 3D vertical stand since it is easier and more accurate to adjust the lateral support to the correct position in 3D.

<p align="center">
Extrude the lateral support into 3D objects and locate them to the 3D vertical stands, then boolean difference.
</p>

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ : The final step is to "make 2D" of the new vertical pieces with the lateral support cutout and locate it back inside the bounding box created in step 3. I also adjusted the display color and layout of the 3D stand and phone a little bit in this step.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£: Laser cut
#### After I finished with the Grasshopper file, I baked two sets of 2D cell phone stands into an illustrator file for laser cut: one is of `45 degrees` and the other is of `70 degrees`, and brought them to laser cut. 

<p align="center">
<img width="700" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Heziaaaaa/blob/main/image/week-3/lasercut.png">
 </p>
 
#### As can be seen, being laid out on the same 1/4" x 18" x 30" plywood, the required space of the design is much smaller than the original. The leftover part is also of straight edges and regular shape, which makes it good for reuse in other projects.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£: Assemble and Display
#### The final step is to assemble the cutout pieces into a 3D functional cell phone stand.
