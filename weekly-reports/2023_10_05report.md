# Report 6 - Week of 10/05/2023 #

### During this week, I have done:
1. Meet up with my teammates in "Mindful Meditation" group
2. Constructed a Figma team and shared a Figjam board with teammates, and we did research together. I was mainly focusing on the mechanical part of the blooming flower since I came from an architecture background and this felt more native to me.
3. Wrote the design specification together in the Google doc. I took care of the design brief and technological challenges part.

## Introduction of the Project ##

I am in the group of Mindful Meditation. My teammates are Adorey Shen, Jade/ Hyeryong Kim, Baurzhan Abenov, Xingchen Cao, and Maria-Teresa Carmier Villalobos. We collectively decided to work on making a device called Meditation Bloom. 

Meditation Bloom aims to amalgamate technology, aesthetic, and mindfulness, crafting a transformative physical and mental experience. It is a meditation-assistive device that provides a multi-sensory experience by integrating visual, tactile, and audial cues, thus enhancing the user's focus and immersion during the meditation process.
### üß©. Components
1. #### Meditation Flower 

   **Function:**
   
   Opens and closes in synchronization with the prescribed meditation breathing pattern.
   
   **Design:**
   
   Resembling a delicate flower that blooms and retreats, providing a visually calming and metaphorically rich imagery.
   
   **Technology:**
   
   Utilizes mechanical petals that are controlled by a microcontroller, ensuring smooth and synchronized movement.
   
   **Lighting:**
   
   Subtle and adjustable lighting that complements meditation moods and provides ambience.

2. #### Vibration Wristband

   **Function:**
   
   Vibrates subtly, aligning with the meditation breathing pace and providing tactile feedback for breathing synchronization.
   
   **Design:**
   
   Ergonomic, lightweight, and non-intrusive, ensuring comfort and aesthetic appeal.
   
   **Technology:**
   
   Employs a precision haptic motor which can adjust vibration intensity and pattern, to avoid startling the user and to align accurately with the
meditation rhythm.

### üí≠.Challenge

The main challenge of our project includes:
```
1. A smooth mechanism for the Meditation Bloom to open and close up.
2. Robust and quiet motor for the Meditation Bloom to ensure non-disruptive drive of the mechanical part.
3. A reliable communication protocol between the Meditation Flower, wristband, and app, ensuring synchronized operation.
4. High-precision haptic technology in the wristband for subtle and accurate vibrations.
```

## üëÄ.Research ##

The first challenge is to figure out the mechanism of the physical flower.  We went through a lot of initial research and found two different methods to achieve the opening up and closing effect

1. one is through rotation that drags the petal to close up

2. and the other is vertical movement forcing the branch to spread out like an umbrella.

   </p>

After a group discussion and a rough prototype, we collectively decided to go with the rotation mechanism, for we think it is easier to put into practice considering the limited time we are given.

## ‚úã.Sketch Model ##
To test out if the mechanism really work, we did a quick sketch model during the class time. Below is the first quick ‚Äúrough‚Äù test model we made for this.

Basically there is a central rotating disc with each petal attached to it by a piece of string. The distance between the two attachment points doesn‚Äôt change, so when the disc rotates, the straight-line distance decreases, petals are pulled inward.

To enhance the visual impact and make the flower appear more stunning, I decided to duplicate the mechanism into multiple layers of petals. Here is a quick sketch of me envisioning the final design of our physical flower.
