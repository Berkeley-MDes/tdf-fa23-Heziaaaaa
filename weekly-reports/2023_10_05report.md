# Report 6 - Week of 10/05/2023 #

### During this week, I have done:
1. Meet up with my teammates in "Mindful Meditation" group
2. Constructed a Figma team and shared a Figjam board with teammates, and we did research together. I was mainly focusing on the mechanical part of the blooming flower since I came from an architecture background and this felt more native to me.
3. Wrote the design specification together in the Google doc. I took care of the design brief and technological challenges part.

## üëÄ.Research ##

The first challenge is to figure out the mechanism of the physical flower.  We went through a lot of initial research and found two different methods to achieve the opening up and closing effect

1. one is through rotation that drags the petal to close up

2. and the other is vertical movement forcing the branch to spread out like an umbrella.

After a group discussion and a rough prototype, we collectively decided to go with the rotation mechanism, for we think it is easier to put into practice considering the limited time we are given.

## üî®.Sketch Model ##
Below is the first quick ‚Äúrough‚Äù test model we made for this. Basically there is a central rotating disc with each petal attached to it by a piece of string. The distance between the two attachment points doesn‚Äôt change, so when the disc rotates, the straight-line distance decreases, petals are pulled inward.
