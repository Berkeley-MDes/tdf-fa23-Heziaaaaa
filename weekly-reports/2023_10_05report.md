# Report 6 - Week of 10/05/2023 #

### During this week, I have done:
1. Meet up with my teammates in "Mindful Meditation" group
2. Constructed a Figma team and shared a Figjam board with teammates, and we did research together. I was mainly focusing on the mechanical part of the blooming flower since I came from an architecture background and this felt more native to me.
3. Wrote the design specification together in the Google doc. I took care of the design brief and technological challenges part.
