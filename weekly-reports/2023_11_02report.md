# Report 10 - Week of 11/02/2023 #

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi. Welcome to the documentation of Mini Yuhe's birth log, a digital counterpart and creative extension of Yuhe Niu. This log serves as a journey through Mini Yuhe's inception, development, and evolution, offering insights into the application of ZeroWidth and LLMs.

## ðŸ§© . Structure

In order to make the following demonstration easier to understand. I want to introduce the structure of my LLM first.

Here is the screenshot of my ZeroWidth Workspace. There are one Intelligence named ` NNâ€™s Journal Log`, and there are three Knowledge Sets called `NN_Info` ,`NNâ€™s Project 1`, and `NNâ€™s Project 2` . 


In my `NNâ€™s Journal Log` Intelligence, I've organized four instructions, including a welcome message, an overview about me (with a linked 'name' variable), and brief introductions to Project 1 and Project 2.

Complementing this, I've established three distinct knowledge sets: one detailing my personal information (`NN_Info`), and the other two each providing around 10 specific pieces of information about Projects 1 and 2, respectively (`NNâ€™s Project 1`, and `NNâ€™s Project 2`). Each information is basically a sub-section of my PDF project report. By using this methods, I successfully limited the tokens of each information to around 250-300 tokens, which also turned out to work perfectly fine in the demoâ€™s API (the Chat Bot never gave me error of using too many tokens in demo).

These knowledge sets are directly linked to the corresponding instructions for seamless integration. The following image shows the whole picture of my structure.

## ðŸ¤¯ Challenge Level 

Challenge Level: 01-Triceratops
I chose the simplest level because this is a rather short project and LLM is the most unfamiliar topic for me so far. The challenges I encountered during this project are:
1. Effectively structure the database within limited tokens
2. Navigate between Intelligence and Knowledge Set and understand their relationship
3. Adjusting variables such as similarity threshold and temperature to control the output of Chat Bot and how much information was correctly pulled out

---

## ðŸ“„. Documentations of the Process

I have explored 4 aspects of LLMs parameters in ZeroWidth:
1. The construction of information in Knowledge Set
2. How to better guide user in API to ask the right questions by constructing the welcome message and other instructions right
3. Adjust Similarity Threshold
4. Adjust Temperature

### 1.  Construct & Link Knowledge Set

I had experimented with two options to input the information in Knowledge Set.
The first involved manually entering each piece of data, which I did for the basic information knowledge set (`NN_Info`).

   </p>

The second option was to upload the PDF reports containing all the details of the two projects and let ZeroWidth automatically generate the information pieces.
