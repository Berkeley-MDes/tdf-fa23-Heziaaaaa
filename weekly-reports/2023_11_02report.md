## ðŸ§© . Structure

In order to make the following demonstration easier to understand. I want to introduce the structure of my LLM first.

Here is the screenshot of my ZeroWidth Workspace. There are one Intelligence named ` NNâ€™s Journal Log`, and there are three Knowledge Sets called `NN_Info` ,`NNâ€™s Project 1`, and `NNâ€™s Project 2` . 


In my `NNâ€™s Journal Log` Intelligence, I've organized four instructions, including a welcome message, an overview about me (with a linked 'name' variable), and brief introductions to Project 1 and Project 2.
