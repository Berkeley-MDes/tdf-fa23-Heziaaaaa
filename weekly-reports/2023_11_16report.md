# Report 12 - Week of 11/16/2023 #

### During this week, I formed the team with Xinyu and Carina for Project 4, and we have worked on several stuffs:
1. I formed the team with Xinyu and Carina for the Project 4.
2. We decided on a theme for the Project 4. Instead of doing the original Emo Projector, we decided to create a device that captures verbal dream descriptions and uses AI to generate corresponding narratives and visual illustrations for userâ€™s to transform fleeting dreams, akin to the symbolism of a dreamcatcher, into a painted form using the power of AI in an intuitive way, and convert them into stories that can be preserved.  
3. Because the nature of our project of capturing dreams, we name our project as `Dreamweaver`.
4. We met with Jeff to discuss the technical challenges of our project. The following image illustrates the workflow we talked about. And I'm going to explain more about the workflow in the following section.

## Technological Workflow
1. Photon as Voice Recorder and record the user's dream.
2. Photon sends voice data to Python in wav format.
3. Python turns voice into speech with OpenAI
4. Python sends the user's speech to ChatGPT.
5. Train CahtGPT with a specific system message to generate a 100-word short stroy and a prompt for DALL.E with consistent style and format. 
6. ChatGPT generates the corresponding story and pormpt for DALL.E
7. ChatGPT sends the message back to Python. Python sends DALL.E pormpt to DALL.E
8. Python receives the coded image from DALL.E and decoded as jpeg image.
9. ChatGPT sends the 100-word story to a text-to-speech API and receives the voiceover as a mp3
10. Python controls the laptop to display the DALL.E image and plays its corresponding story together.

## Task Allocation

Physical Computing Development: Includes soldering, wiring, coding, and testing of the hardware. (Xinyu & Carina & Yuhe)
Prototype Development: Designing of the product form, 3D printing of the prototype, Refining and Polishing. (Carina & Xinyu)
Software Development: Training of the AI model and integration with the hardware. (Carina & Yuhe)
Integration Development: Coding for interaction within the entire ecosystem and the device. (Yuhe & Xinyu) 
Testing and Refinement: Both hardware and software will undergo rigorous testing to ensure reliability and user-friendliness. (Yuhe & Xinyu & Carina)

Yuhe (Nancy)
- Write the Python code for the program
- Work out all the connection between Python and LLMs (ChatGPT and DALL.E)

Carina
- Train the system message for ChatGPT and DALL.E
- Design and 3D print the exterior look of the dreamweaver

Xinyu
- Write the Particle code for the voice recorder for Photon
- Solve out the wireless connection between laptop and Photon
