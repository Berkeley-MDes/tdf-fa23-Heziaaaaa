During Monday lecture, I was assigned to Group 7 with the topic of "Energy" for the initial brainstroming.

Our brainstormed ideas can be categorized into 2 different groups:
1. Energy saving
2. Visualizing energy

And we have four different types of users:
1. Individual
2. Big company
3. Household
4. Kids

Finally, we came up with four ideas for four different scenarios: 
1. An online educational system portraying energy use and methods of energy conservation for children to learn more about energy and energy saving.
2. An system converting the intangible energy save into some tangible data which is more comprehensive for general public so that they can get a better idea of how much energy they save.
3. Creating a small carbon trading center and platform aimed at individuals within a community can empower citizens to take actionable steps toward energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction. 
4. Visualizing the intangible energy in the nature, like radiation, air flow, heat flow, for users to actually "see" the energy flow.
