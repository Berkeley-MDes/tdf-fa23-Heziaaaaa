## 1️⃣ Ideation for "Energy" on Monday lecture

During Monday lecture, I was assigned to Group 7 with the topic of "Energy" for the initial brainstorming.

Our brainstormed ideas can be categorized into 2 different groups:
1. Energy saving
2. Visualizing energy

And we have four different types of users:
1. Individual
2. Big company
3. Household
4. Kids

Finally, we came up with four ideas for four different scenarios: 
1. An online educational system portraying energy use and methods of energy conservation for children to learn more about energy and energy saving.
2. An system converting the intangible energy save into some tangible data which is more comprehensive for general public so that they can get a better idea of how much energy they save.
3. Creating a small carbon trading center and platform aimed at individuals within a community can empower citizens to take actionable steps toward energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction. 
4. Visualizing the intangible energy in the nature, like radiation, air flow, heat flow, for users to actually "see" the energy flow.

## 2️⃣ Pick the most interesting ideation for me

I personally was not very interested in the energy topic since I was sort of bounded by my architecture background. The energy saving was already much discussed in the architecture field and hence I want to try something new for this project.

I was first drawn to the idea of meditation flower in "Health" section, which is `Mindful Meditations: An interactive Flower Guide for Stress Relief and Color Therapy Tracking`. It reminds me of the old defualt voice player of windows system which will showcase colorful pattern that change according to the beat of the music played. I think it will be interesting to make this into a physical reactive device that physcially reacts to sound.

For the same reason, I was also drawn to the `Exploring Laser Wind Chimes: Enhancing Entertainment & Recreation through Sound and Visual Artisty` in "Recreation and Entertainment" section. It would also be intriguing to create an interactive device that translates between sound and the visual. 

The last one I chose is `Enhancing Home Security: Exploring Cheap and Removable Door Lock Sensors for Share Household and Renters` in "Home" section. I am deeply related to this topic since I also have the very traditional door locker that can be opened with only a key. It is very inconvenient since sometimes I forget my key and get easily locked out of my home. I feel this is a very realistic question and I am excited to explore how to solve this question by myself with the help of Photon2.
